Hey, I'm **Ben White**, I'm a 18 year old developer from **Auckland, New Zealand**, currently studying **Software Engineering** in **Sydney, Australia**. I create projects to help others, and in the process - learn new things for myself. I'm allways learning, and will likely never stop growing.  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an open-source alternative to retail POS and ERP. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m trying to learn everything I can, that I have yet to explore, specifically in terms of production; Kubernetes, Deno, Rust, and more!
- ðŸ¥… 2023 Goals: Contribute and create more to Open Source projects and make a large rust project (working on this one now!)
