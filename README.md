Hey, I'm **Ben White**, I'm a 17 year old developer from **Auckland, New Zealand**. I create projects to help others, and in the process - learn new things for myself. I'm allways learning, and will likely never stop growing.  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working a free VPN service ðŸ¤«
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m trying to learn everything I can, that I have yet to explore, such as Kubernetes, Deno, and more!
- ðŸ¥… 2022 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects and make a large rust project!

Feel free to take a look at my [portfolio](https://ben-white.vercel.app/), or contact me on discord: unrealg#4406, [twitter](https://twitter.com/@UnRealG3) or via [email](unrealdev.buisiness@gmail.com). Talk soon ðŸ‘‹!
