Hey, I'm **Ben White**, I'm a 20 year old developer from **Auckland, New Zealand**, currently studying **Software Engineering** in **Sydney, Australia**. I create projects to help others, and in the process - learn new things for myself. I'm allways learning, and will never stop trying to grow!  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on systems programming problems, working toward scalable software. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m trying to learn everything I can, that I have yet to explore, specifically for testable, reliable solutions.
- ðŸ¥… 2025 Goals: To bring academia into practice, to create efficient code to solve complicated challenges.
